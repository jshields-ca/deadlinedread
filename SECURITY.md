## 🎮 Game-Specific Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
Since Deadline Dread is a client-side web game, most security concerns relate to:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious code injection
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Local Storage**: Secure handling of game data
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Keeping dependencies updated

### What We're Not Concerned About
- **Server-side vulnerabilities** (no server component)
- **Database security** (no database)
- **Authentication bypass** (no authentication system)
- **API security** (no external APIs)

## 🔍 Vulnerability Types We're Interested In

### High Priority
- **XSS vulnerabilities** in game UI or user input
- **Code injection** through game mechanics
- **Data corruption** that could affect gameplay
- **Performance attacks** that could crash the game

### Medium Priority
- **Information disclosure** through game mechanics
- **UI manipulation** that could confuse players
- **Local storage vulnerabilities** affecting game data

### Low Priority
- **Cosmetic issues** that don't affect functionality
- **Performance issues** that don't create security risks
- **Browser-specific quirks** that don't pose security threats

## 🛠️ Security Measures in Place

### Development Practices
- **Code Review**: All changes are reviewed before merging
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of npm packages
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for all user inputs
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers where applicable

### Build Process
- **Minification**: Code is minified to reduce attack surface
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production builds
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
