## [2.0.0] - 2024-07-18

- Mutated Standard and other enemy tweaks

### Technical

## [1.7.5] - 2024-07-17
### Fixed
- **Level Up System:** Fixed critical bug where level up screen was not appearing. Added proper levelUpCallback setup.
- **Player Boundaries:** Fixed player movement to properly clamp to canvas boundaries instead of referencing undefined window.canvas.
